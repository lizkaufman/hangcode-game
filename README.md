# HangCode

**Hosted at https://hangcode.netlify.com**

## Background:

This project began as a pair programming project during week 10 of School of Code, when the task was to translate knowledge from a well-known game into a React app, and we chose hangman with a code-themed twist. Sarah took the lead with the snazzy styling, while I led on the game mechanics underneath the hood.

At the end of the week, we had the functioning one-player game, with a bank of ten React-themed words, one of which is chosen randomly and guessed by the player. I enjoyed working on this so much that I've made my own repo of it to keep tinkering with it further.

## Ideas for future improvements:

- Two-player functionality with socket.io
- Chat window to go with this (with socket.io as well)

## _Default README from Create React App below:_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
