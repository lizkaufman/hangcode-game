# HangCode

**Hosted at https://hangcode.netlify.com**

## Background:

This project began as a pair programming project during week 10 of School of Code, when the task was to translate knowledge from a well-known game into a React app, and we chose hangman with a code-themed twist. Sarah took the lead with the snazzy styling, while I led on the game mechanics underneath the hood.

At the end of the week, we had the functioning one-player game, with a bank of ten React-themed words, one of which is chosen randomly and guessed by the player. I enjoyed working on this so much that I've made my own repo of it to keep tinkering with it further. I'm planning, as a personal project, to make it two-player with socket.io to really cement my understanding of web sockets for something beyond a basic chat app. I've spoken to my mentor and some fellow bootcampers for guidance and am diving into the docs, blog posts, etc. to plan my approach. Watch this space! :)

## Ideas for future improvements:

- Two-player functionality with socket.io
- Chat window to go with this (with socket.io as well)
